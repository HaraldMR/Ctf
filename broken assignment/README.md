# broken assignment
After completing my assignment, I eagerly prepared to submit it. However, an unexpected hurdle emerged as the school's submission policy demanded that all assignments be in .xps file format. Consequently, I had to rely on an online converter to convert my work. At first glance, the converted file seemed acceptable, but upon closer inspection, it appears that the converter has introduced some issues. Can you find the problem?

Note: this challenge shares the same file as flag Mono.
